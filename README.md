## Previous Project
### In my earlier project, I created a command-line calculator that performed simple arithmetic functions. This project laid the groundwork for understanding basic functionalities and user interactions. You can find the code for the command-line version <a href="https://github.com/pandeymansi/Simple_Python_Calculator">here</a>.
## Upgrade Highlights
- **User Interface:** The new version features a user-friendly GUI, making it easier to interact with the calculator.
- **Enhanced Functionality:** Additional functionalities have been implemented, including buttons for each operation, a clear display for input/output, and error handling.
- **Improved Usability:** The GUI allows for a more intuitive experience, suitable for users of all ages.
